# Pandas-Homework

Used the Pandas Library in Python to create DataFrames for the analysis of School Data and Scores
The techniques used are mainly DataFrame.merge( to combine the give data sets and dataframes/pivot_tables), pandas.pivot_table ( to generate the analysis for each categorical group), and pandas.cut( to slice the data into bins with categorical labels)

Three Oberservable trends from this analysis are as follows:
1. Schools with higher budget per student tend to have higher passing percentages
2. Smaller schools have higher passing percentages
3. Charter schools tend to perform better than district schools
